## Privacy

The "think" tool does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. It serves purely as a thinking space for the AI assistant and only processes the content provided in the input parameters. No data is retained after the tool execution completes.

This tool does not connect to external services, APIs, or databases, ensuring that all information remains within the current conversation context.

The only data processed by this tool is the thought content provided in the request, which is temporarily used to acknowledge the thinking process and then discarded after the response is generated.
